## Troubleshooting

### Logs Not Appearing

2. Verify bot has permission to send messages in log channel
3. Run `/logstatus` to check configuration
4. Restart bot after config changes

### Admin Pings Not Working
1. Verify bot admin IDs in config.py
2. Check bot has permission to ping users
3. Ensure admins are in the same server as the log channel

### Permission Errors
1. Bot needs "Send Messages" permission in log channel
2. Bot needs "Embed Links" permission for proper formatting
3. Bot needs "Mention Everyone" permission to ping admins
