Admin or restricted commands (not included above)
- Logging admin commands (testlog, setlogchannel, logstatus) are implemented in `Cogs/logging_system.py` and are labeled [ADMIN].
- Owner-only commands are implemented in `Cogs/owner.py` and are restricted to owner IDs.

Notes on visibility and permissions
- The project uses runtime permission checks (`has_any_role_ids`, `has_permission` etc. from `config.py`) to control who can execute commands.
- Many cogs set `default_member_permissions` defensively so commands are not shown in the UI for users without Manage Roles; this is a fallback and not a complete per-owner UI hiding strategy. For precise visibility control, use per-guild application command permissions or the Developer Portal.

If you want
- I can generate a single `commands` help command that returns this README content or a short summary in-chat.
- I can generate pytest tests for a subset of these commands (permission checks and basic behavior).
- I can produce a per-guild permission applier that tries to lock these commands to certain roles or owner-only visibility (requires bot token with appropriate permissions).
